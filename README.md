# Overview

1. **Funding Barriers for Environmental NGOs**

   * Many small to medium-sized environmental organizations struggle with consistent funding and visibility.
   * Donors have little transparency on how their funds are used.

2. **Corporate Greenwashing**

2. **NFT Marketplace**

   * Users explore and purchase NFTs of their choice.
   * Each NFT represents support for a real-world ecological initiative.

3. **Direct Funding**
