# Overview

1. **Funding Barriers for Environmental NGOs**

   * Many small to medium-sized environmental organizations struggle with consistent funding and visibility.
   * Donors have little transparency on how their funds are used.

2. **Corporate Greenwashing**

   * Companies often claim carbon offsets without verifiable records or decentralized proof.
   * Traditional carbon markets lack transparency and public accountability.

CarbonX leverages Solana's speed and cost-efficiency to provide:

* A decentralized **marketplace of eco-NFTs**.
* **Direct NFT purchases** that send funds to verified environmental projects.

   * Each organisation will have their collections,in which they can add different nft's as per their proof-of-work.

2. **NFT Marketplace**

   * Users explore and purchase NFTs of their choice.
   * Each NFT represents support for a real-world ecological initiative.

3. **Direct Funding**

   * Users get a digital asset they can showcase or trade.

4. **Corporate Carbon Offset**
